```

Then reboot the system...

2. Right click on `MalUnpackCompanion.inf` from the driver package. From the context menu, choose "Install"
3. After the driver is installed, it remains inactive. In order to activate it, run the following command as Administrator:
```
fltmc load MalUnpackCompanion
```

## How to unload

Run the commandline as Administrator. Deploy the command:
```
fltmc unload MalUnpackCompanion
```
